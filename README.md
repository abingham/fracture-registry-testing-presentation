# Presentation on automated testing in the fracture registry

This is an `org-reveal` presentation on the automated testing the fracture registry.

1. In this directory, get the [latest version of reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/releases). Unzip/unpack the release, and rename the resulting directory to "reveal.js".
2. Make sure your `org-reveal-root` is set to `./reveal.js` (e.g. `(setq org-reveal-root "./reveal.js")`).
3. Run `org-reveal-export-to-html-and-browse`.
